# LEDController
That was the subject of my MSc diploma thesis as an electrical engineer.

This application searches for a PIC32 participant on Ethernet with UDP broadcast messages which is prepared to control the brightness of a power LED,
to count the number of turns of the cooling fan, and to measure the temperature of the heatsink.
After searching it connects to the PIC32 trought TPC connection to give the setpoints and to get actual values.

This aplication uses ControlLab from Mitov Software. ControlLab is free for non commercial purposes. This means that you can use it for personal pleasure, hobby, or evaluation purposes. If you are student you can also use it for free for your educational needs including school projects. If you are a tutor at present you also can use it for free for your classes. However in the near future a low cost tutor license will be available, and you will have to purchase it. Your students however will not need license to use the product at class.

You can download the package:
